                <h1> Hi, I'm Michael McNally </h1>
                <p>
                    I fell in love with coding almost 3 years ago during the COVID quarantine, and have kept
                    at it ever since. I'm currently an MCIT student at the University of Pennsylvania School of
                    Engineering and Applied Science, where I serve as a TA for CIT 5930 - Introduction to
                    Computer Systems and CIS 5500 - Database and Information Systems.
                    I am also currently a software engineer intern at <a href="https://suchef.xyz">suchef</a>.
                    I am interested in all things computer science, but in particular find myself drawn to robotics,
                    embedded systems, and distributed systems. I like to tinker with my Arduino and Raspberry Pi, as
                    well as write C++ code for the ns-3 network simulator. Outside of coding I like to ski, cook,
                    travel with my wife, and practice Muay Thai and Brazillian Jiu Jitsu. You can find links to some of
                    my projects below, and some more projects at my <a href="https://github.com/mmcnally1">Github</a>.
